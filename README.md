DATA ENGINEERING:
There were 6 total tables included in the CSV dataset:
•	departments
•	dept_emp
•	dept_manager
•	employees
•	salaries
•	titles
It was found that there are really two "main" tables: departments and employees. The other tables relate to these two tables. As such, departments has the dept_no  primary key while employees holds the emp_no  primary key and the other four tables have at least one of those two fields as foreign keys.
